# Escape the Dungeon

This is a sample project written in C++ and using the SFML library. For demonstration purposes.

###### The game: 

You're trying to escape a dungeon. Good luck getting out though. There are 100 rooms in total. Upon entering a room, you can't leave until all enemies have been beaten. Every 5 levels a shop appears. He sells you weapons, defenses, and magic. Every 10 levels a boss appears. The shop will also replenish your health for a fee.

If you die, you will return to the first room, but not before visiting the 'spirit shop', which offers bonuses that persist through deaths. Instead of coins, you use souls to buy these bonuses, which are dropped by bosses.

Here are the shop's offerings:

###### WEAPONS:
* Arrow (level 5) (quick and effective shots)
* Sword (level 10) (strong and fast, but limited in range)
* Axe (level 20) (very strong, but slow and short-ranged)
